# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

## Overview
Artificial Neural Networks Models were created to predict whether a customer is a fraud or not.

Imbalanced dataset handling methods were used for better accuracy.

## Methods to handle imbalanced dataset 
* undersampling majority class
* oversampling minority class
* Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (uses KNN)

## Models built
* Dense Neural Networks model with 1 hidden layer
* Dense Neural Networks model with 2 hidden layers

## Prerequisites
* Python 3 
* an IDE 
* Pandas 
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib 
* Sklearn 
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Imblearn

All the external dependencies can be installed by using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
